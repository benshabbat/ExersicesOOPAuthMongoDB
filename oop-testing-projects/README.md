## 🚀 How to Use These Projects

### Step 1: Read the Project Brief
Each project has a README with:
- Project description
- Requirements
- User stories
- Technical specifications

### Step 2: Plan Your Solution
- Think about what classes you need
- Design the methods and properties
- Plan your tests

### Step 3: Write Tests First (TDD)
- Start with simple tests
- Write the minimum code to pass
- Refactor and improve

### Step 4: Use Hints Wisely
Each project includes:
- 🎯 **Hint 1**: Basic structure guidance
- 🎯 **Hint 2**: Method implementation tips
- 🎯 **Hint 3**: Testing strategies
- 💡 **Hint 4**: Common pitfalls

### Step 5: Check the Solution
- Try to solve it yourself first!
- Compare your approach with the solution
- Learn from different techniques

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### OOP Concepts
- ✅ Classes and Objects
- ✅ Constructors and Methods
- ✅ Private Fields (#)
- ✅ Getters and Setters
- ✅ Inheritance and Polymorphism
- ✅ Encapsulation
- ✅ Static Methods
- ✅ Design Patterns

### Testing Skills
- ✅ Unit Testing
- ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- ✅ Edge Case Testing
- ✅ Mocking and Stubbing
- ✅ Test Hooks
- ✅ Integration Testing
- ✅ Code Coverage

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Small** - Begin with Project 01 even if you know some OOP
2. **TDD Approach** - Write tests before implementation
3. **Iterate** - Make it work, make it right, make it fast
4. **Use Hints Sparingly** - Try to solve without hints first
5. **Review Solutions** - Learn from the provided implementations
6. **Extend Projects** - Add your own features after completing them
