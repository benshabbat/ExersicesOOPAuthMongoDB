## 🛠️ Tools for Testing Your Server

You can test your server in several ways:

### 1. Browser (Easiest)
Simply open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### 2. Thunder Client (Recommended for beginners)
- VS Code extension
- Installation: Extensions → Search "Thunder Client"
- User-friendly GUI for sending requests

### 3. Postman
- External application
- Download: https://www.postman.com/downloads/
- Very popular among developers

### 4. curl (Command line)
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## 💡 Important Tips

1. **Work in order** - Each exercise builds on previous ones
2. **Try yourself first** - Don't jump to solutions immediately
3. **Run and test** - After each change, run the code and verify it works
4. **Read error messages** - They explain what's not working
5. **Use console.log** - To understand what's happening in your code

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is localhost:3000?**
A: It's your computer's address. 3000 is the port number.

**Q: How do I stop the server?**
A: Press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

**Q: Server not working, what should I do?**
A: 
1. Check that you installed packages (npm install)
2. Check for code errors
3. Check that port 3000 is not already in use

**Q: How do I know if my code is correct?**
A: Send a request to the server and verify the response matches expected output.

## 📞 Additional Help

If you get stuck:
1. Re-read the instructions
2. Check the examples in the .md file
3. Try searching the internet for the error message
4. Ask friends or a mentor
