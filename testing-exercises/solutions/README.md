## 💡 How to Use Solutions

1. **Try it yourself first** - This is the most important part!
2. **If stuck** - Look at one or two hints
3. **Compare your solution** - See if there are different approaches
4. **Learn from the solution** - Understand why the code is written that way

## 🎯 Comparison Tips

- There's no single correct solution - there can be multiple approaches
- Pay attention to code cleanliness and style
- Learn from recurring patterns
- Notice how edge cases are handled

## ⚠️ Warning

It's not recommended to copy solutions without understanding! 
Learning is in the process, not the final result.
